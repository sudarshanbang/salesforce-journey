## What is Data Modelling?

Data modelling is the process of deciding how business data will be structured and stored.

A Salesforce data model defines:

- Required objects
- Fields inside each object
- Field data types
- Relationships between objects
- Business rules for the data

For the Expense Manager project, the initial objects are:

- Expense
- Income
- Budget
- Expense Category

## Objects in Salesforce

An object stores a particular type of business data. It is similar to a table in a relational database.

### Standard Objects

Standard objects are provided by Salesforce.

Examples:

- Account
- Contact
- Lead
- Opportunity
- Case

### Custom Objects

Custom objects are created according to specific business requirements.

Examples from the Expense Manager project:

- Expense
- Income
- Budget
- Expense Category

Custom object API names end with `__c`.

Examples:

```text
Expense__c
Income__c
Budget__c
Expense_Category__c
